# bayesbio

This package contains a few helper functions that I've found useful in working in R, in particular in bioinformatics,
and a couple (somewhat loosely) related to Bayesian statistics. Thus "bayesbio".

## Installation

Get the released version from CRAN:

```R
install.packages("bayesbio")
```

Or the development version from github:

```R
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("andymckenzie/bayesbio")
```
